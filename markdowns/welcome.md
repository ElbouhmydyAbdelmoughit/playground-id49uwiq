# Welcome!

This React template lets you get started quickly with a simple working example using React (with `yarn`). If it is your first contribution then you should have a look at the [Getting Started](https://tech.io/doc/getting-started-create-playground) document.

The source code for this template is on [GitHub](https://github.com/TechDotIO/react-template), please feel free to come up with proposals to improve it.

# Hands-on Demo

@[Sample React App Boilerplate]({"stubs": ["src/app/app.jsx", "src/main.js"], "command": "./run.sh"})

Check out the markdown file [`welcome.md`](https://github.com/TechDotIO/react-template/blob/master/markdowns/welcome.md) to see how this exercise is injected into the template.

# Template Resources

[`markdowns/welcome.md`](https://github.com/TechDotIO/react-template/blob/master/markdowns/welcome.md)  
What you are reading here is generated by this file. Tech.io uses the [Markdown syntax](https://tech.io/doc/reference-markdowns) to render text, media and to inject programming exercises.


[`react-project`](https://github.com/TechDotIO/react-template/tree/master/react-project)  
A simple React project dedicated to run the exercise above. A project relies on a Docker image to run. You can find images on the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/explore/) or you can even [build your own](https://tech.io/doc/reference-runner).


[`techio.yml`](https://github.com/TechDotIO/react-template/blob/master/techio.yml)  
This *mandatory* file describes both the table of content and the programming project(s). The file path should not be changed.
